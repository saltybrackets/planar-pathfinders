# **Feywild**

Echo of the Prime Material Plane. Emotions heightened. Arcane magic heightened. Weird time flow.

2E: Was the “Plane of Faerie” and basically a transitive plane with no connection to the others (Astral, Ethereal, Shadow).

3E: Link with material greatly weakened.

4E: Strong connection to Prime again, and actually touched the Astral and Arvandor (first layer of Arborea).

## Ideas

- Feywild is gradually starting to touch some Lower Planes: Pandemonium, Abyss, and Carceri. This seems to be a result of Unseelie Court meddling.  
- Feywild is also gradually starting to touch some Upper Planes: Beastlands, Arborea, and Ysgard. Result of Seelie Court meddling.  
- Vortices to the Temporal Energy Plane are opening randomly.
