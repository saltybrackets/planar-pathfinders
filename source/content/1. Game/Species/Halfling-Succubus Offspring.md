The offspring of a union between a Halfling and a Succubus.

- **Age.** Halfling/Succubus offspring reach adulthood at the age of 20 and generally live into the middle of their second century.
- **Size.** Halfling/Succubus offspring average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
- **Speed.** While these offspring do sport a small pair of leathery bat wings between their should blades, they are not actually able to fly. The wings do allow their steps to be lighter and carry them farther. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
- **Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
- **Alluring.** Your beauty and seductive banter transcends natural limits, and draws others toward you. You know the _friends_ cantrip, but without the negative drawback of creatures becoming hostile to you when the spell ends. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling.
