- **Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.
- **Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Skills.** You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
- **Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.
