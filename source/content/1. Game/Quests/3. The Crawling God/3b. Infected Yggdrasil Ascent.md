## The Ranger's Roost
>The rotting remains of an elaborate wooden platform system - bridges, huts, and observation posts built by long-gone rangers or druids who once tended this part of Yggdrasil 

The wooden structures are now partially fused with infected flesh, creating a nightmarish hybrid of carpentry and biology. The owlbear has torn apart sections of wooden walkways and hurled the debris to create barricades. Some wooden posts and beams have become fleshy and pulsate with infected sap. The owlbear uses the remaining sturdy wooden structures as launching points for its attacks, while the infected wooden elements serve as camouflage for its merging ability. Weakened wooden platforms may collapse under the party's weight, potentially dropping them into pools of sap below.

## The Severed Branch Bridge
>A massive branch that once connected to another part of the tree, now hanging at a precarious angle 

**Obstacle:** 
The owlbear has gnawed through support structures, making the bridge unstable. As the party crosses, it emerges partway from the fleshy growths and shakes the branch violently before disappearing again. The party must make Acrobatics 14 checks to avoid falling, and the owlbear spits infected sap at anyone who seems to be maintaining their balance too well.

## The Ancient Observatory
>Crumbling stone ruins of what was once a celestial observatory built into a massive hollow of the tree, with carved stone platforms and broken telescopic devices 

The infection has caused the ancient stones to crack and shift dangerously. The owlbear has knocked over several stone pillars to create barriers and uses the elevated stone platforms to gain high ground for its attacks. Infected sap seeps between the stonework, making surfaces slippery and potentially contaminating anyone who falls. The owlbear merges with fleshy growths that have sprouted between the ancient stones, using the combination of stone cover and organic camouflage to launch surprise attacks.

## The Weeping Hollow
>A natural cavity in the tree where infected sap pools like a crimson lake. Near the top of the tree where the infection meets healthy wood, creating a stark boundary

The owlbear has positioned itself at the transition point between infected and healthy tree. It uses the healthy branches above to drop debris while remaining protected by its ability to merge with the infected flesh below. The boundary itself is unstable - healthy wood occasionally "rejects" infected material in violent bursts. 

Touching the sap requires Constitution saves or begins the infection process. The owlbear lurks merged within the fleshy walls, occasionally hurling chunks of its own flesh at anyone who gets too close.
