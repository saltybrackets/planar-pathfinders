## Overview
- The party is side-trekked (by their own interest) to [[The Lantern Cairn of Dym]]. This may be a good place to introduce [[Carolyn's Character]], probably having taken up residence with [[Dym]]. If they become friendly with Dym, they explain the changes the party will continue to undergo, and it is strongly encouraged the party stay here a few nights to acclimate. 

- Within the tower, they are actually on Brux (the second layer), and there is a party going on around them, held by the Seelie Court.

- Upon leaving the tower, the party can see thick storms overhead, raging particularly bad around the giant tree. The jungle surrounding the tree looks slightly different from this distance, taking on a slightly more reddish tint. A party member may notice faces in the clouds.

- The party is approached by [[Tarnu]], a talking monkey. He reveals that he saw the party enter the tower a few months ago, and a lot has changed since then.

## The Fey Party
>**Setting:** The forest clearing is decorated with floating lights, flower garlands, and a small stage made of woven branches. Each representative has their own area: Gulpwell near a table laden with sweets, Melodia by a circle of singing flowers, and Thornwick in a small garden maze..

>**Atmosphere:** The representatives are friendly and encourage participation. They're more interested in seeing creativity and good sportsmanship than perfect performance. Even those who fail challenges are offered consolation prizes (minor trinkets or temporary blessings).

#### Gulpwell the Gluttonous' Eating Contest
>Gulpwell speaks in a booming, enthusiastic voice and frequently compliments good eating.

A bullywug named [[Gulpwell the Gluttonous]] challenges a **Conrad** to a cupcake eating contest, though another party member could opt to take his place. They take turns eating cupcakes.

The bullywug is apt to cheat using his [[Bullywug Tongue]], which could store about 400 cupcakes on its own. An **Insight DC 12** check may expose this plot, in which case the bullywug will remove its tongue, and the two make contested rolls as normal (the Bullwug has a Con of 12, +1 to save) and 25 hitpoints.

###### Mechanics:
- Can safely eat up to **3 + Con mod** cupcakes.
- **DC 10 Con Save** for each cupcake after or take 1d8 "food" damage. Once damage = current hitpoints, can't eat any more. If they attempt to eat more, they throw up, which will breach fey etiquette. 
- **Reward:** [[Bullywug Tongue]] -- the bullywug also loses the ability to speak.

#### Thornwick The Riddle-Root's Riddle Garden
>Thornwick speaks slowly and thoughtfully, often pausing mid-sentence to consider his words.

[[Thornwick]] presents three nature-based riddles that must be solved in sequence. Each riddle involves understanding natural cycles, plant behavior, or forest wisdom.

- "I drink from below yet reach for above, I breathe out life's gift and in return receive love. In autumn I sleep, in spring I wake, what am I for the forest's sake?" _(Answer: A tree)_
- "Born in darkness, I seek the light, I'll crack stone and concrete with all my might. Small I start but mighty I grow, through the tiniest spaces I'll always show." _(Answer: A seedling/sprout)_
- "I have no roots yet I am fed, I have no leaves yet I'm not dead. I break down the old to make something new, the forest's recycler, through and through." _(Answer: Mushroom/fungus)_
- **Reward:** [[Verdant Compass]]

#### Sqeulaiche the Court Jester's Three-Card Truth
>Sqeulaiche speaks with theatrical flair and dramatic gestures, often breaking the fourth wall with winks and asides. He delights in wordplay, puns, and turning serious moments into comedic ones

[[Sqeulaiche]] (pronounced "") presents a magical shell game where he uses his trickster powers to challenge the party's wit and perception. He presents three golden cards that constantly shift and change, hiding a "truth" beneath one of them.

###### Mechanics
- Sqeulaiche shuffles three golden cards on a small table, each showing different symbols (clover, crown, jester's hat)
- He hides a glowing orb of "truth" under one card, then begins shuffling with magical flourishes
- Players must make a **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check to track the orb through his illusions
- Alternatively, they can make a **DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation)** check to detect the magical patterns in his shuffling
- Success grants the reward; failure means Sqeulaiche laughs heartily and offers them a consolation prize (a chocolate coin that grants advantage on their next ability check)
- **Reward:** [[Jester's Coin of Fortune]]
- **Consolation Prize:** [[Jester's Chocolate Coin]]
