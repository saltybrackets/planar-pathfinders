## Setup  

- The party needs to get to some large settlement (Sigil?), due to some bit of advice Demorial gives.  
- The usual Concordant Express train won't be coming by Ribcage again for another week. 
- The party can ask around town and eventually find another train depot. This ones leads into the side of a maintain.  
- The train itself appears to be biomechanical, metal fused with meat. A literal meat train. It departs at antipeak (midnight).  
- Modest Mina happens to be on the same train already, and will assist the party entirely out of boredom.

## Cast 

- [[Ramon]] (Rah-mon): Elderly kyton (chain devil). People keep calling him "Raymond." Sits at the back of the train. Deep in the grips of dementia, dialogue meanders until the party can bring him his coveted fishing lure (which is a dead cat actually named Raymond). At that point, Ramon can tell the party just about everything they ever wanted to know about the train, and can even assist them to some extent. Ramon's chains lace throughout every car of the train, and in fact hold the whole train together.  

- [[Birch]]: Based on the character Mahogany from Midnight Meat Train. 7ft tall, muscular, wearing a grey suit, buzzcut, heavy brows. Carries a heavy iron canister, which he uses to beat people to death. Inside the canister is a white powder, which is actually meat tenderizer. Birch is nigh unkillable, but does have an affinity for cats, and thus can be placated with the dead cat/fishing lure Raymond. Otherwise, never responds to the party directly, though will pursue them in/after later murder tunnels.  

- [[Nadia]]: Gothy woman, wears a classic dress. Caked on makeup, pale, with deep red lipstick, long dark hair. Like Nadja from WWDITS.  

- [[Lazerus]]: Stocky, bearded. Wears a dapper black vest with red collar. A simple human who keeps getting killed and then resurrected. Like Lazlo from WWDITS. Has been riding for longer than he can remember. "Killed" at the first murder tunnel. 

- [[Carl Robertson]]: Incredibly boring/aggravating person, does nonlethal damage to characters simply by talking to them. Like Colin from WWDITS. Also killed in the first murder tunnel.  

- [[Namby the Tireless]]: Bearded, shoulder-length dark hair. Wears regal, green robes. Natural foil to Carl Robertson, a bearded fellow who never sleeps. Like Nandor from WWDITS. Tries to attack Birch after Carl is killed.  

- [[Seraphine Stillblood]]: Tiefling alchemist. Red hair almost looks like a tumbleweed, dark goggles, smells like lavender. Mostly ignores the party, silent. Birch considers Seraphine to be his mother, and will not hurt her (in fact, hearing her voice is a way to pacify him). Mumbles Oxford sentences to herself repeatedly, and these might greatly mislead the party into thinking they have some value:  

    > "It's easy to tell the depth of a well."  
    > "Smoky fires lack flame and heat."  
    > "The pearl was worn in a thin silver ring."  
    > "The bill was paid every third week."  
    > "Move the vat over the hot fire."  
    > "The empty flask stood on the tin tray."  
    > "The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."

## Objectives  

- Find Ramon's covetedÂ  fishing lure.
- Evade Birch if he pursues the party. Ways to pacify Birch:  
	- Give him the dead cat.
	- Hearing his "mother's" voice.
	- Tanglefoot bag from Seraphine.  
- Change routes, which Jig can do by shooting a lever outside at a certain point (10 rounds from discovery)  
- Control train to get it to do what the party needs via hacking its brain.

## Scenes / Encounters

- While in a car with Birch and a few other folks, the train passes through a tunnel, cloaking the entire room in pitch darkness (magical). The party can hear: Footsteps. A woman (Nadia) screams. A loud, wet thud. Carl says "What the fuck?" Another wet thud. Someone else (Lazerus) says "The deuce? Oh, here we go again". Another wet thud. When the car exits the tunnel, everyone is standing relatively in their same places, but three people are dead (Nadia, Carl, Lazerus), and Birch is covered in blood, blood dripping from his metal canister. Namby becomes enraged at the loss of his friend and attacks Birch, stabbing him repeatedly to seemingly no effect. And, contrary to his name, becomes tired from the exertion. Birch summarily caves his skull in with his canister.  
	- After a bit, Lazerus gets back up from, all wounds gone. 
	  "I say chap, what's the point? You just keep ruining my smashing ensembles with blood and scalp fragments, I'll not be becoming one of your DELECTABLE finger sandwiches any time soon, you KNOW this."  

- As the players near the engine while on the roof, Birch will tear through the roof (literally, pulling it apart like muscle fibers) . He can't actually pull himself all the way up, but will still injure players that get too close. A strong shot to the head will cause him to fall back into the train, and the roof will heal itself.  
 
- Also on the roof of the train: Party will be attacked by flying creatures (4x giant bats) in dim light. A spotlight can be activated to raise visibility, but one player must use an action each turn to direct it. The party should be able to hear the creatures in advance, and will have 3 rounds to prepare and/or pre-emptively attack before the creatures reach them.

## Locations

*Cars are generally about 60 feet long, 10 feet wide, 10 feet tall.*

- **Engine Room:** The heart of the train is a fusion of machinery and pulsating organic matter. Massive gears interlock with tendons, and a dark, viscous fluid drips from the ceiling, pooling on the floor. The air is thick with the smell of burning oil and decaying flesh. The players might encounter malfunctioning constructs and smaller demonic entities that maintain the train's operations. They must navigate the dangerous machinery to avoid injury. The train can detect the player's thoughts, and if players communicate with it in some way, they'll learn the train has no intention of ever delivering them to their destination. Deciphering the runes indicates the mind of the train SHOULD be controlled through arcane programming, but that programming was circumvented by the train itself long ago. Direct access to the train's brain can be accessed on the engine room's roof. The only way to get to the roof is from the rear car -- all windows are actually nigh-unbreakable translucent flesh. Bringing the train back under control requires alternating Arcana and Thievery checks -- Arcana to access information centers of the brain via electrical stimulation, Thievery to manipulate the arcane bindings.  
	- Arcane Cortical Bindings:  
		- Frontal (DC 20): Motor control.  
        - Occipital (DC 18): Visual senses.  
        - Parietal (DC 16): Spatial senses.  
        - Temporal (DC 15): Language/memory/emotions  

- **Main Artery:** A long tube that runs along the entirety of the train, to all cars, basically controlling hydraulics and nutrient delivery. Big enough that a person could get in, but would have to be a very strong swimmer. Hydraulic Push could also be used to force someone else to another area of the train. Openings respond to pH differential (higher pH opens valves, after which they close after 1d2 rounds).  
-
- **Passenger Car:** This car appears more mundane at first glance, with rows of seats. However, the seats are made of sinew and bone. This is where the first scene takes place, revealing the nature of Birch.  

- **Dining Car:** The dining car is a grotesque parody of luxury, with tables set with silverware and fine china resting on fleshy, quivering tablecloths. The smell of cooked meat, both enticing and revolting, fills the air. The chefs are flesh golems, and the food served is disturbingly human-like. They might attack if provoked or if the players refuse to partake in the meal. A menu written in Infernal hints at ingredients that could be used to create a concoction to slow Birch down.  

- **Observation Car:** The observation car has large windows offering a view of the hellish landscapes the train traverses. The seats are luxurious, made of supple leather, but the ambiance is tense and foreboding. This car is relatively safe, offering a brief respite. However, illusions of past victims of the train might appear, offering dire warnings or misleading the players. A hidden compartment in one of the seats contains a diary from a previous traveler who encountered Birch, with detailed notes on his weaknesses. There's also a button near one of the windows that will actually open to the outside (though it's too small for anyone to crawl through). This will be needed if Jig want to fire through it to hit the track change lever.  

- **Living Quarters Car:** This is actually a grab-bag of both sleeping quarters/rooms and portals to other places.  
    - Birch's Room: Dozens of painted portraits of cats. Easel, oil paints. Plates packed high will deli meats. A sink with a mirror, with a scalpel nearby it. In the sink are dozen of bloody little skin growths. Stuffed in a locker is a dead cat (Raymond). There's also a speaker mounted in the corner of the ceiling, a woman's voice repeating every minute "The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."  
    - Asmodeus's Asshole: A door opens to what looks like a sphincter, coated in blood. Investigations in Birch's Room could indicate that the meat he prepares eventually ends up here, to feed "Daddy."  

- **Birch's Meat Car:** Freezing cold train car, dozens of dead bodies hung on hooks, marble slabs covered in blood, butchering implements. On the wall is taped up a route map for the train. Studying the map, players may discover which route they're on, as well as numerous points on the route that are circled red (murder tunnels). This can give them some insight into there being a possible track change, which can avoid all the tunnels while still getting them to the same location.  

- **Laboratory Car:** This car is a twisted alchemist's lab, with tables covered in bizarre, otherworldly experiments. Vials of strange liquids bubble, and mutated creatures writhe in cages. The alchemist, Seraphine, might be willing to trade knowledge for a price ("Get me something to eat from the Dining Car."). She'll also give the party an abnormally strong tanglebag, which can keep Birch rooted in place temporarily.  

- **Cargo Car:** This car is filled with crates and barrels, some of which have broken open to reveal horrific contentsâparts of demons, rare magical components, and sinister artifacts. The walls are lined with pulsating veins and muscles. All the barrels and crates are held firmly in place and closed by chains, which upon close examination can move on their own if interacted with. Among the cargo, the players find a chained book that details a binding ritual, potentially useful against Birch.  

- **Rear Car:** The final car is a sanctuary of sorts, with walls covered in chains and runes. The air is thick with the scent of brimstone, and the floor is lined with blackened bones. The elderly chain devil, Ramon, resides here. His mind wanders, but he holds fragments of crucial information about Birch and the train. He offers cryptic advice and pieces of his own tragic backstory, revealing that he once tried to control the train but failed -- now he is bound to service the train instead.  

- **Escape Car:** Not really a car, but a handcar (aka pump trolly, aka pump car), which can be detached if the players convince Ramon to let go of it.
