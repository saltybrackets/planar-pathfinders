> - **Tainted Waters.** Water within 10 feet of the plesiosaurus becomes murky and foul. Creatures that start their turn in this tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of their next turn.
>###### Actions
> - **Bite.** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with stygian rot. The cursed target takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The curse lasts until removed by *remove curse* or similar magic.
>###### Special
> - **Corrupted Thrash (Recharge 5-6).** The plesiosaurus thrashes violently, causing the water around it to churn with dark energy. Each creature within 15 feet of the plesiosaurus must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
