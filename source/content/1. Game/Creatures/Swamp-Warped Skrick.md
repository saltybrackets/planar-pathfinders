*Once colorful, proud jungle birds, the skricks now stagger on misshapen limbs, their wings dissolved into fibrous fins that churn through mud like oars. Translucent skin pulses with internal gills and parasitic veins. Eyes blink sideways. Their cries are hollow, echoing with something... deeper.*

> - **Aquatic Mutation.** The skrick can breathe both air and water. It treats mud and wet earth as water for movement and can burrow through it without leaving a tunnel.
> - **Warped Cry (1/Short Rest).** When it is wounded (below half HP), the skrick releases a warbling, corrupted shriek. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on their next attack roll or saving throw before the end of their next turn.
> - **Abolethic Corruption.** When the skrick dies, its body dissolves into foul ichor. A creature that touches or is splashed by the ichor must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute.

> - **Emerge and Strike.** *Only while burrowed.* The skrick erupts from wet terrain, making a single Beak and Tendril attack. If it hits, the target cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn.
