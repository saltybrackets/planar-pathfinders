>###### Traits
> - **Flesh Merge.** As a bonus action, the owlbear can merge with infected flesh growths on Yggdrasil, becoming invisible until the start of its next turn or until it attacks. It can move through infected areas as if they were difficult terrain while merged.
> - **Regenerative Flesh.** At the start of its turn, the owlbear regains 5 hit points if it has at least 1 hit point and is in contact with infected tree matter.
> - **Infectious Presence.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the owlbear must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn.
>###### Actions
> - **Multiattack.** The owlbear makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite, or it can use Hurl Flesh twice.
> - **Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage.
> - **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 16). While grappled, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.
> - **Hurl Flesh.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage. The hurled flesh regrows at the start of the owlbear's next turn.
> - **Spew Infected Sap (Recharge 5-6).** The owlbear vomits infected sap in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) acid damage and is covered in sap. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't covered in sap. A creature covered in sap has its speed reduced by 10 feet and must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the creature takes 4 (1d8) acid damage and gains one level of exhaustion. The sap can be removed by using an action to scrape it off or by taking fire damage.
>###### Reactions  
> - **Flesh Shield.** When the owlbear takes damage while merged with infected tree matter, it can use its reaction to reduce the damage by 7 (2d6).
