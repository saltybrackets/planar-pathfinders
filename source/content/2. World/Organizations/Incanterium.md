The **Incanterium** are a faction, turned sect, turned faction once again. They believe that wizardly magic is the secret to the multiverse.

The Incanterium collected every magical item and scrap of magical lore in the Tower Sorcerous, which loomed over the Clerk's Ward. Factions would trade magic for help or knowledge. There came a time when the factions gradually came to be dancing on the Magicians' leash.

Then the Tower Sorcerous vanished. Rumors flew that the Lady of Pain sent the whole structure to the Mazes. Centuries passed, and the Incanterium were forgotten.

But some were still left over, wandering the planes, calling themselves **incantifiers** or [[Incantifier]]s, pursuing their goal of learning all the magic in the multiverse.

... and then, one day, the Tower Sorcerous reappeared.

- **Factol**: Unknown
- **Headquarters**: Tower Sorcerous, Clerks' Ward
- **Aligned Plane**: Astral Plane
- **Members**: Mages, lore seekers, scribes
- **Epithet**: Incantifers

## Philosophy
Incantifiers believed magic was the ultimate power of the planes: archmages would redefine the laws of their worlds, even gods feared it. You could control the entire multiverse, if only you learned enough magic. It has, after all, been done before.
