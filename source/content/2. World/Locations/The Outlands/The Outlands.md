The Concordant Domain of the Outlands, also known as Concordant Opposition, is the center of the Great Wheel of Outer Planes. It connects to all other Outer Planes and is truly neutral in alignment.

It is an infinite plane, yet has a definite center (the Spire with Sigil on top). The properties of all the other Outer Planes are mixed together in the Outlands; good, evil, law, and chaos exist here in all their forms, but are less able to affect each other due to the neutralizing effect of the plane

While there is no sun in the Outlands, the plane still has day and night cycles.

Around the outer edge of the Outlands are sixteen evenly spaced settlements that are each constructed around a portal to one particular Outer Plane. For that reason, each gate-town shares many characteristics of the plane to which it connects.

The sixteen gate-towns are:

- **Excelsior**: A beautiful, well-defended city with a kind population, it connects to Mount Celestia.
- **Tradegate**: A star-shaped city that bristles with commerce and constant activity, it connects to Bytopia via a complex trade system with a bariaur known as the Master Trader.
- **Ecstasy**: A peaceful, pastoral town, it connects to Elysium.
- [Faunel](https://app.kanka.io/w/321869/entities/7687673): A ruined city, but bristling with life, it connects to the Beastlands.
- **Sylvania**: A constantly partying town where music plays day and night, it connects to Arborea.
- **Glorium**: A fishing village built at the edge of a fjord, it connects to Ysgard via two different portals. Another branch of Yggdrasil leads to a cavern near the city.
- **Xaos**: Also known as aXos, sXoa, oasX, and all other permutations, it is an ever-changing city that connects to Limbo.
- **Bedlam**: A fan-shaped town built haplessly on the slopes of the Maurash hill, it connects to Pandemonium.
- **Plague-Mort**: A diseased, ruined, and decaying town, it connects to the Abyss.
- **Curst**: A bleak, dusty city organized in rings, it connects to Carceri.
- **Hopeless**: A large city with a single entrance and organized as a spiral, it connects to Hades.
- **Torch**: Built on the slopes of a range of volcanoes and surrounded by a disease-ridden marsh, it connects to Gehenna.
