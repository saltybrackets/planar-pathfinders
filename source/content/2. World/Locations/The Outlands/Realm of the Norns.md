Fates are spun and severed in the Realm of the Norns, a community of seers who divine meaning from mystical signs across the planes.

On the horizon looms the sunset-like arch of a phenomenally huge spinning wheel that turns endlessly. Locals gather in a few village-sized hubs, but most keep to themselves in private hermitages, observatories, or other structures from which they ponder fate's particularities.

Many people bearing magical curses also live in the area. While some hunt for ways to end the magic affecting them, most have accepted their conditions and live peacefully.
