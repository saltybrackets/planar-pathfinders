Located just outside the town walls, the Gymnasium of Steam provides respite to weary travelers who have business in [[Ribcage]]. The resort leverages a network of scalding geysers and terraced volcanic springs to create a paradise of steam rooms, saunas, and luxurious baths. Nobles schmooze with mercenaries and sellswords in the gymnasium's humid, ruby-tiled chambers, plotting the demise or demotion of their neighbors.
