Ribcage is the blackened heart of the Vale of the Spine, a jagged range of barren mountains whose peaks curve insward around a smoldering valley. Iron walls encircle the fortified town, and two rows of cracked, dry spires of rock curl over its arid sky -- the earthen ribs from which the gate-town derives its name. Ribcage's menacing, arched gates, festooned with wings like those of a bat and forged from infernal steel, allude to the power of the Lords of the Nine Hells.

Bound to the Nine Hells and its rigid hierarchy of backstabbing Fiends, Ribcage obeys a strict but mobile caste system. Stratified by morality, residents climb the rungs of society through guile, treachery, and devilish deals to obtain power at any cost. As a result, the town's lowliest paupers exhibit redeemable qualities, while the nobility are all but soulless.
