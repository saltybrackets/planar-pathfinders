An interplanar train dutifully operated by the modrons (a race of incredibly bureaucratic clockwork creatures from the plane of Mechanus). The clockwork behemoth chugs along the planes, leveraging a network of portals -- to which the train functions as a key -- to deliver its cargo and passengers across the multiverse on a tight schedule. Planar travelers, tickets in hand, hustle to and from the ever-bustling platforms as buzzing modron crews unload freight cars.
