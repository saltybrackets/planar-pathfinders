>###### Traits
> - **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Sqeulaiche fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
> - **Magic Resistance.** Sqeulaiche has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> - **Court Jester's Prerogative.** Sqeulaiche cannot be charmed, frightened, or compelled to act against his nature. He can speak freely to any creature, regardless of their status or power, without consequence.
> - **Reality Jester.** Sqeulaiche can alter reality within 1 mile of himself in minor ways as a bonus action - changing colors, creating harmless illusions, or rearranging small objects. These changes last until he dismisses them or leaves the area.
> - **Innate Spellcasting.** Sqeulaiche's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>   - At will: *Minor Illusion*, *Prestidigitation*, *Vicious Mockery*, *Misty Step*
>   - 3/day each: *Polymorph*, *Greater Invisibility*, *Confusion*, *Modify Memory*
>   - 1/day each: *Wish*, *Time Stop*, *Reality Rift*, *Mass Suggestion*
>###### Actions
> - **Multiattack.** Sqeulaiche makes three Trickster's Touch attacks or casts three spells.
> - **Trickster's Touch.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d6 + 9) force damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by *confusion* for 1 minute (save ends).
> - **Jester's Paradox (Recharge 5-6).** Sqeulaiche creates a 60-foot radius area of chaotic magic centered on himself. All creatures in the area must make a DC 24 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are transported to a harmless demiplane that resembles a carnival funhouse for 1 minute, then return to their original location. On a success, they gain the benefits of *haste* for 1 minute.
> - **Grand Illusion (1/Day).** Sqeulaiche creates a massive illusion affecting a 1-mile radius. This functions as *mirage arcane* but can include moving creatures and sounds. The illusion lasts for 24 hours and is indistinguishable from reality except by *true seeing* or similar magic.
>###### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
> - **Cantrip.** Sqeulaiche casts a cantrip.
> - **Teleport.** Sqeulaiche casts *misty step* without expending a spell slot.
> - **Fool's Wisdom (Costs 2 Actions).** Sqeulaiche targets one creature within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to speak only truth for 1 minute, but in an exaggerated, theatrical manner that reveals embarrassing secrets.
> - **Reality Shuffle (Costs 3 Actions).** Sqeulaiche swaps the positions of any two creatures within 120 feet of him, or transforms the terrain in a 30-foot radius around him into a different type of terrain for 1 minute.
