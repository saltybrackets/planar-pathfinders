A lake at the end of a River Oceanus distributary that is home to a tribe of plesiosaurus. The waters have since been corrupted by the [[Meat Train]] as it passed through the distributary (resting there for a bit).

As such, the plesiosaurus here have become infected by stygian mutation, becoming [[Stygian-Touched Plesiosaurus]]. Dark veins pulse beneath its hide, eyes glowing with dim red light. They have become even more carnivorous, depleting the lake of its food stores, and they are now starving and ravenous.

- [[Were-Beaver]]s have since damned in the lake to prevent the plesiosaurus from leaving. Solemnly, they wait for the dinosaurs to starve themselves to death. They would mercy-kill the dinosaurs, but they dare not enter the water for fear of becoming poisoned, or worse, infected with the same curse.
