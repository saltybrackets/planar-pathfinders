This seemingly peaceful forest hums continuously with low, overlapping tones, like whale songs or warhorns played in reverse. The trunks appear healthy but feel hollow, and tapping them causes them to sing back in strange harmony.

- As the players enter, they witness a group of deer standing perfectly still around a dead tree, as though in silent mourning. One wears a small iron mask.
 - Listening closely to the wind reveals whispers of past conversations, including one the party had aboard the train, repeating in strange cadence.
 - A druidic glyph in a high tree knot will resonate with anyone carrying part of the train or affected by its psionics. Meditating here allows a player to ask one question, answered cryptically in musical tones (similar to Augury, once per long rest).
