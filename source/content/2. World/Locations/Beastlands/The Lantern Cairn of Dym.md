A crumbling stone tower inhabited by a talking animal spirit, [[Dym]], once the familiar of an [[Incantifier]] named [[Kythron Vex]].

This tower leans precariously at the edge of a high ridge. Lanterns hang from its perimeter, each one lit by a different color flame (red, green, or blue) that never burns out. Inside is a fox, named Dym, who claims to have once been a wizardâ€™s familiar.

The frame of the entry door is actually two thick roots coiled together. These were a natural occurance, the tower build around them, as the bounded space between them is actually a two-way portal to the second layer of the Beastlands, Brux. A basher may be able to tell this by the golden light suffusing the room on the other side.

Within the tower, the light is warm, pouring in from windows that reveal a very similar landscape as the corresponding first layer, just at sunset.

At this particular time, the Feywild touches the forest surrounding the tower (on the Brux side), and the Seelie Court is holding a party there. The former master of the tower was friendly with the fey, and they've come to see him. Unbeknownst to them, it's been hundreds of years since they last saw him.

- If treated with respect, Dym explains the changes the party will continue to undergo, and it is strongly encouraged the party stay at the tower for a few nights to acclimate.
- When the party departs, if they were friendly, Dym provides a [[Portal Compass]] (though it is currently unattuned).

Dym may mention that there is a library in the basement. If the party does go down into the basement, they actually pass through a portal into the third layer, Karasuthra. As such, when the leave the basement, the party being held by the Summer Court around the tower is already over.

The basement library can be used to conduct planar research. At a writing desk is the last journal of Kythron.
