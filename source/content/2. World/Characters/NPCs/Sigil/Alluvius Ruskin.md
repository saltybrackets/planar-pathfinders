 "If Sigil is the City of Doors, then it's also got to be the city of keys — it just follows."

So says Alluvius Ruskin, owner of [[Tivvum's Antiquities]], the largest supplier of gate keys in the Cage. Need a white rose petal to open a gate to Arborea? Or how about a baatezu heart for a trip to the frozen wastes of Cania? Whatever the key, it's a good bet that the object's in a bin, barrel, or case at Tivvum's.

Alluvius, a small, elderly tiefling, speaks in a shaky voice, but she's fiercely confident about her business. "I've had to work twice as hard to get my good reputation," she says. "It's almost been the death of me! I know what folks think when they see a tiefling, and believe me, it ain't 'Here, take my jink!'"

Alluvius (Lu, for short) exaggerates just a bit. But no one else knows that practically nothing could be the death of her. She's an incantifier. She no longer lives in the normal sense of the word, having no need to breathe, eat, or sleep; instead, she feeds on magic. Lu can absorb the effect of any spell thrown at her or drain every last drop of power from any magical item. Fact is, she must — she's got to absorb enough magic each month to keep from permanently losing some of her own power.

But Lu's need for magic goes far beyond just sustaining herself from month to month. For an incantifier, magic is the key to everything because it equals might — if a body gets enough of it, he can bend the multiverse to his will. Centuries ago, the incantifiers were a full-fledged faction in Sigil, called the Incanterium and nicknamed the Magicians — the magic-addicts grew in power and influence until they could make the other factions jump.

Then they just disappeared one day, citadel and all.

Most folks chalked it up to the Lady of Pain. But a few incantifiers remained. One of them, a blood named Tivvum, took Alluvius under his wing; she underwent a dozen years' worth of spells and rituals that transformed her into a Magician in her own right. And whether Tivvum left the Cage in search of life-sustaining magic or ultimately met the same fate as his fellows, one day he, too, vanished — leaving Lu in charge of Antiquities.

Lu's determined not to fade away like her incantifier predecessors. She figures they went about their mission of collecting all the magic in Sigil a little too obviously. As she sees it, a Magician ought to have a bit more sleight of hand — especially if she hopes to get one up on the Lady.

See, Lu's ultimate goal is to drain Sigil itself of magic, and she's looking for a magical item (or perhaps a one-of-a-kind wild magic surge) that'll let her do it. Lu figures that the Lady derives power from the city. That means she'll get weaker as Lu gets stronger. And when Alluvius rules Sigil — and all the wondrous magic of its portals — she imagines she'll also rule the multiverse.

'Course, this is no small feat for the frail tiefling. But while she gathers every spell and magical item she can get her hands on (often trading them for gate keys), she's got a scheme in the works that might quicken her rise to power. She trades raw evil magic to the shadow fiend Ly'kritch in exchange for gems that contain trapped intellects. Lu hopes that, sooner or later, the fiend'll bring her a gem that houses the spirit of a wizard strong enough to help her defeat the Lady.

Legend has it that, millennia ago, an unnamed wizard almost put Sigil's high-up down all by himself. But the Lady managed to capture his mind in an orb and stash it deep in a cave on Pandemonium. Now, Lu's sources tell her that the "orb" — really a gem — is in the possession of a shadow fiend in the Lower Planes. She wants to find that gem, free the wizard, and gain an ally for her eventual showdown with the Lady.

So far, Lu hasn't found the wizard's spirit. But she refuses to give up — even in the face of rumors that a berk named Shekelor met a gruesome end while hunting for the mage himself. That prospect doesn't faze the incantifier; she figures she's tough enough to handle most anything. What's more, the gems she gets from Ly'kritch aren't wasted. Lu sells them — trapped minds and all — as gate keys to unsuspecting planewalkers.

Better yet, most of the gems are consumed when used to open portals. Lu has a good cackle over the possibility that the spirits within die painful, permanent deaths in the process. Many a customer's remarked at the glee with which Lu sells her gems, even the cheapest hunk of blue quartz. "It's just that I so enjoy my job," she answers, turning away with apparent modesty (though it's to hide a lascivious grin).

## Appearance and Demeanor
No one'd guess at the power behind the tiefling. She looks like a weak, elderly, human female, with small horns poking up through thin, silvery hair. Lu's wispy, gray strands curl up at the ends and hang slightly aloft, as if caught in a light breeze. She's known to wear eccentric garb for a tiefling of her years — often a long, fitted, dark green jacket with tails, and leggings of a gray and green pattern that define her spindly form.

Much of her appearance and demeanor is little more than a show to mask her identity as an incantifier. She wears thick, oblong spectacles of darkened glass to hide her telltale shiny silver eyes and make her seem all the more vulnerable and imperfect. She also recently donned leather gloves after an observant customer noticed a light blue glow around her fingertips (the magic inside her spills out sometimes).

Lu hides her natural grace and agility by moving about the shop slowly and clumsily — "Whoops! Another crystal ball for the glass shards bin. Oh, well, one key's as good as another!" And hardly anyone misses the fact that she's always snacking on bones, meat tidbits, or crunchy, roasted insects. She downs the tiefling treats voraciously, even though, as an incantifier, she has no need for food at all.

For the most part, Lu tries to avoid overtly casting spells in front of others. She doesn't mind tossing off a few simple tricks now and then, using Hornung's guess to estimate how many silver heads are in a barrel, or fabricate to weave bits of string into a rope. She might even cast Evard's black tentacles to detain troublemakers until her key golems can pull themselves together. But Lu doesn't want to betray her superior command of magic; she prefers to rely on her golems — or one of her many magical items — for defense against all but the gravest of threats. (If necessary, she can throw a punch that hits like a club, chalking her incredible strength up to a "magical ring" that is, in truth, merely a ring of protection.)

Speaking of magical items, Lu's open about her hunger for acquiring such prized objects. 'Course, she claims she's simply "fascinated" by such wondrous things (as is another well-known tiefling about town, Kylie). Fact is, Lu's been known to hire customers right off the floor to seek out various magical items, or even make a purchase from A'kin at the Friendly Fiend.

## Philosophy and Plans
See, the tiefling's learned from the example of others who've tried to challenge the Lady. Aoskar, self-proclaimed god of portals, now floats on the Astral a withered husk. The Expansionists scattered away a thousand years ago when their blustering factol got tossed into a Maze. Even Lu's own predecessors, the Incanterium, vanished right when they seemed poised to take over the Cage.

Alluvius plans to avoid their mistakes. She will grow in power silently, slowly draining the city itself of its magic, until the vast power of Sigil flows through her blood, is hers to command. And then the Lady'd better watch out.

Bone Golems have the same stats as a flesh golem, but their attacks also include this ability: 'If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.'
>###### Special
> - **Absorb Magic (Reaction).** If someone tries to cast a spell that would affect Alluvius, she can use her reaction to instead absorb that spell. When she absorbs a spell, she gains temporary hit points equal to the level the spell was cast at.
