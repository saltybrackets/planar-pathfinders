> - **Ancient Wisdom.** Thornwick has advantage on Intelligence (Nature) and Wisdom (Insight) checks.
> - **Innate Spellcasting.** Thornwick's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>   - At will: *Druidcraft*, *Guidance*
>   - 3/day each: *Entangle*, *Speak with Plants*
>   - 1/day: *Plant Growth*
>###### Actions
> - **Thorn Lash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.
> - **Riddling Words (3/Day).** Thornwick speaks a confusing riddle. One creature within 30 feet that can hear and understand him must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn as it puzzles over the riddle's meaning.
