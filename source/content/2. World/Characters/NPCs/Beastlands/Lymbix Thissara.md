The stygian aboleth sloughed off a portion of its brain at some point, due to it wanting to shed the part of itself that was subservient to the devils. It is friendly toward [[Francis]], essentially being the part she interacted with. 

After being separated, the small portion of brain melded with and took over a snake petitioner (from whom it took its surname) for the sake of locomotion, its personality melding with it to become somewhat more altruistic.

It retains some of the more recent memories of the original aboleth, but only its surface motivations.

## Special Properties
Is capable of melding with inanimate matter having a surface area (not volume!) between 200 (full coverage) and 2000 (sparse/10% coverage) square feet. This is the minimum needed to give the object locomotion, and only up to 5 tons on land, or 50 tons in water.
