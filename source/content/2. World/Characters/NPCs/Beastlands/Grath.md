>###### Traits
> - **Shapechanger.** The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
> - **Keen Hearing and Smell.** The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
> - **Powerful Grappler.** The werewolf can grapple creatures up to one size larger than itself without penalty. When the werewolf grapples a creature, it can use its bonus action to make one bite attack against that creature.
> - **Rage (3/Long Rest).** As a bonus action, the werewolf enters a rage for 1 minute. While raging, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, deals +2 damage with Strength-based melee attacks, has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and cannot be charmed or frightened. The rage ends early if the werewolf is knocked unconscious or if it hasn't attacked or taken damage since its last turn.
> - **Reckless Attack.** At the start of its turn, the werewolf can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
>###### Actions
> - **Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** The werewolf makes two attacks: two with its spear (humanoid form) or one with its bite and one with its claws (hybrid form).
> - **Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.
> - **Claws (Hybrid Form Only).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
> - **Spear (Humanoid Form Only).** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
> - **Glory Hold (Hybrid Form Only, Recharge 5-6).** The werewolf attempts to grapple a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Athletics or Acrobatics check (target's choice). On a failure, the target is grappled and restrained (escape DC 15). While maintaining this hold, the werewolf cannot move or take other actions, but at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage as the werewolf crushes them. The werewolf can maintain this hold on creatures up to one size larger than itself.
>###### Bonus Actions
> - **Grappler's Strike.** If the werewolf has a creature grappled, it can make one bite attack against that creature.
