Once the apprentice of [[Kythron Vex]], left alone in [[The Lantern Cairn of Dym]] after his master left and never returned (hundreds of years ago). He has long since forgotten what his master was like, merely that he had one. He can't actually remember if he was an apprentice, or a familiar.

> **Appearance:** 
> Dym is a russet-red fox with an unusually luxurious coat that seems to shimmer with an almost imperceptible magical aura. Silver-white fur traces elegant patterns around his eyes and muzzle, while his tail tip gleams like starlight. His most striking feature is his eyes—deep amber orbs that hold an ancient, knowing intelligence far beyond that of any mundane fox. A thin silver chain around his neck bears a small crystal pendant, a gift from his former master. > 

>  **Personality:** 
>  Dym carries himself with the dignified bearing of a scholar, often sitting upright with his tail curled neatly around his paws while listening intently to conversations. He speaks in measured, thoughtful tones with a slight archaic formality—a remnant of his years studying alongside his wizard master. Though generally patient and wise, Dym can be surprisingly playful when comfortable, occasionally indulging in fox-like antics that seem to embarrass him afterward. He has a particular fondness for riddles and word games, and becomes visibly excited when discussing magical theory or ancient lore.

> **Quirks:** Dym has retained several fox mannerisms despite his awakening—he still caches small treasures around his tower, tilts his head when concentrating, and has an irrepressible urge to investigate new scents. He speaks to the wind when lonely, believing it carries messages between planes, and always knows exactly when dawn and dusk *would* occur in the Beastlands, often pausing his activities to observe these transitions in respectful silence.
