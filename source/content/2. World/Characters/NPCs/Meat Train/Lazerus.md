Stocky, bearded. Wears a dapper black vest with red collar. A simple human who keeps getting killed and then resurrected. Like Lazlo from WWDITS. Has been riding for longer than he can remember. 

"Killed" at the first murder tunnel on the [[Adventure - (Midnight) Meat Train]], but just keeps coming back to life for some reason.
