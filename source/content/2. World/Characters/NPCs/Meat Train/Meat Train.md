*Rather than a mechanical train of wheels and steel, this train is one of... meat.* 

*The main engine, at least, does somewhat resemble a typical train, albeit a biomechanical one being covered in chains, tangles of wires, and eerie, pulsating red lights. Also, at the very front, an incredibly large, elongated, pulsating brain. The cars behind it linked together like lengths of intestine, the "door" to the first passenger car a sphincter-like portal.*
