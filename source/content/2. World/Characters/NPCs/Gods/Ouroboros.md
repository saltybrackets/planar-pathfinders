A forgotten god of cyclical divinity, the embodiment of the Unity of Rings, once worshipped in obscure corners of the multiverse. It died not through battle, but self-annihilation -- symbolic of its own dogma.

It still exists somewhere in both the Astral plane and the Ordial plane, in a state of simultaneous life and death. Its body remains completely dead, but its mathematical basis, the embodiment of recursion, exists within the Ordial.
