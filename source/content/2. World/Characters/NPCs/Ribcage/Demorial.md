A very large, horned rat-thing who was supposedly a former Duke of the Nine Hells. TheÂ  rat continually twitches and shivers as it speaks.

The former Duke appears to be a legitimate information broker, but won't reveal his secrets for free, requiring a barter first.

Currently resides in [[Ribcage]], frequenting the entrance bar of the [[Gymnasium of Steam]].
