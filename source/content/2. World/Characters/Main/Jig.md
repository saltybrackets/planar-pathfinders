## Backstory

While attempting to jump into a time hole, Jig unwittingly jumped into a portal to Sigil's Hive Ward. The existence of portals was, until now, unknown to his world. The experience was overwhelming and horrifying, leading to him escaping the city and finding the least-populated place he could find. He ended up outside 

Barry's world has gone through two different disasters. The first is a series of time... events (time holes, as he calls them), which overwhelmed the world and left the original Barry as only one of three survivors. The second is the expansion and subsequent collapse of the Barry population caused by the original Barry attempting to fix the world (see "post-disaster" below).

Pre-disaster: Routine, kind of boring life for a mid-30s divorced man, working at a unionized welding shop, in a suburban area, with a neighbor who absolutely hates him for a series of incredibly minor infractions. Recovered/recovering alcoholic, though that wasn't the reason for the divorce. No children. Ex-wife, who he married just after high school (before she left for college), worked in some kind of experimental research, which he knows absolutely nothing about.

Post-disaster: Jig is a time-created copy of Barry, retaining all his pre-disaster memories, and is the only survivor of the the Collapse, an event in which Barry attempted to fix the time fracture he originally created by repeatedly jumping into time holes and copying himself 6 billion times, before the population grew to the point where it could no longer sustain itself. Each copy was changed due to minor fluctuations, and Jig is a Barry copy with unusually good survival skills, though his survival has been partially based on luck instead of skill (there was a lot left over from the first collapse). This has given him an inflated amount of confidence in his abilities.

Jig goes by the name "Jig" instead of "Barry" because he is terrified that someone knows about what happened in his world, and feels they would blame him for what happened. He will eventually have to admit this to someone.

Jig has just been surviving since he landed in Sigil, and has not made any progress towards all this time stuff. He's confident he could fix what Barry never could, and is trying to find someone skilled in time-magery, or whatever this world calls that kind of thing. Maybe someone else knows what he doesn't?

What happened to Barry's world is a causal loop; in the future, he flung stuff back through time holes trying to help his past self, which in turn gradually destabilized and destroyed the world. He has no idea this is what happened.

Jig is all-or-nothing, throw-it-at-the-wall-and-pray. Either what he does works really well, or it doesn't work at all.

## Goals

- Get past mere survival, which is all he's been concerned about. 
- Understand something about where he is and how he got here. 
- He still has no idea about how portals work.
- Find someone who understands time holes and understand what happened to his world.
- Find a portal back to his own world and fix it. This is definitely something he can do, and it will not result in even worse things happening as a result. This Barry is different.

## Material Rewards
- Think of anything with a high chance of succeeding or failing; he'll use it and hope for the best, thinking "oh yeah this is going to go well."
