## Backstory
An elf, started his adventure from a village populated by sentient cats, near [[Faunel]].

In his earlier life, he was busy toiling for a necromancer boss, Sarif, to whom he is in thrall. He eventually struck up a bargain with a resurrected knight, Adam, who is also a slave to Sarif, to find a way to free themselves from the hold the boss has over them.

Francis was able to put Sarif under a limited time sleeping spell, and they made their escape.

He's not much of a people person but knows the skills and experience of those in the party could potentially help. He knows he cannot go it alone even if he'd prefer it that way.

## Goals / Motivations
- **Short-term:** Obtain more knowledge to help the party. Knowledge is power. 
- **Mid-term:** He will never admit this, but he is trying to get along better with Jig, even as Jig annoys him frequently. Jig in many ways reminds him of Adam. 
- **Long-term:** Increase abilities to help with quest back home. Get the thing that will help free them from Sarif and get back home in one piece and more of a badass (It's totally not so he can impress Adam).
- Francis is trying to find a particular item that could help free them from the necromancer.

## Likes
- Francis is partial to snakes and has adopted it as iconography in many of his spells. His last name means Firesnake in elvish. 
- Items with snake iconography will always draw his interest, but anything increasing his magical abilities and self-protection will be top priority. 
- He would love to add new magical toys to his arsenal. If it has snake symbolism, that would be the cherry on top.
