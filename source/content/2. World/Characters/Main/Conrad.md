## Backstory
He ended up in the Outlands after him and a few peers with vaguely related goals engaged in an unsanctioned ritual on school grounds to create a portal that traverses planes, in a reckless attempt to break out of his enforced career/life path. This landed him in Ribcage due to its alignment proximity to the evil empire he resides in.

Conrad was/is a university student at the Dredgoth Memorial Institute of Arcana at Steamengard, being taught to master the necessary spells for the water-half of the steam engine operations role he was born into. 

He's an Evocation major - Occult minor - with decent but not exceptional grades. However he's a deeply unhappy student looking to escape his fate. 

His only friends at the university are those outsiders who share his displeasure. Although unlike him, most of them are more inclined toward rebellion against the empire than merely escaping their caste as he does, so they don't trust him much and this is likely the reason he was picked to try going through the experimental portal first. As far as he's aware, none of his peers went through after him. 

He has a complicated relationship with his mother who does the same work (as do most everyone in his family) and she is both proud of that work and extremely patriotic. 

He doesn't know his father, who - as is traditional for breeding water casters - was a genie temporarily summoned from the plane of Elemental Water. He's never given any thought toward ever meeting his father until getting stuck in the Outlands, where the possibility of doing so no longer seemed 100% impossible.

Being stuck on the other side of their poorly documented portal ritual was absolutely not in any of Conrad's plans. He doesn't think things through that far ahead. So besides surviving, he's just making it up as he goes. Though he does feel torn between his natural curiosity to explore and have novel experiences, and his instinct to find a way back to prove the ritual worked. Luckily, both of those things align with what the party is currently trying to do: reaching Sigil sounds novel and exciting, and also promises a potential way back.

---
## Goals / Motivations
- Find a way into Sigil. 
- He wants to learn a wider array of spells and maybe find - while he's in this multiplanar place - any leads on his father and perhaps a way to meet him. 
- Long term, he wants to use the experiences here to his benefit to prove he's too valuable to remain a simple operator, and should instead be an official Experimentalist, or perhaps an Overseer, or even an Archwizard, any of whom would enjoy great freedoms within the empire on his home material plane.
