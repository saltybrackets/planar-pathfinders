## Backstory
A blacksmith who used to fabricate parts for the [[Gymnasium of Steam]]. Often worked with [[Reginald Pipefitter]] to maintain its plumbing. 

Initially joined the party to figure out what happened to [[Thadeus]] and Reginald in the underworks. Eventually discovering that Reginald is dead, she's basically lost her primary contracting partner and is out of a job, leading her to finally make the leap to follow her dreams of becoming a magical arms smith in Sigil.

---
## Goals / Motivations
- Become a magical arms smith in Sigil. Specifically Sigil, as magical weaons/armor are most useful and valuable when they originate from there.
- Settle down with one person (generally self-sabotages this, though, due to insecurity about whether succubus side is the only reason someone might love her)

---
## Likes
- Sex. Sex. Sex. But rarely has it, due to insecurity about succubus lineage.
