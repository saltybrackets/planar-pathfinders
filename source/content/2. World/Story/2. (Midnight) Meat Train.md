On the advice of [[Demorial]], the party decides they need a better information broker—ideally in a larger, safer settlement like Sigil. The nearest route appears to go through Automata, which might also have a portal to Sigil’s Foundry. Alternatively, Thebestys was also nearby Automata, which could also have a better information broker.

The usual travel option, the Concordant Express, isn’t due for another week. However, locals mention a mysterious alternative train arriving around antipeak (midnight). Curious, the party heads to the station, which is eerily deserted except for [[Mina]], who overheard their plans and wants to travel to Sigil as well.

When the train finally arrives, it's nothing like they expected. This is no ordinary engine—it’s a grotesque meat train, a fusion of biomechanical horror and fleshy abomination. The engine pulses with red lights and has a massive brain at its front. Passenger cars resemble linked intestines, accessed through sphincter-like doors. The seats are sinew and bone; the walls, thin skin with translucent sections acting as windows.

Among the other strange passengers is Birch, a bulky, expressionless man in a gray suit, holding a metal canister. Attempts at communication fail—he seems entirely unaware of their presence. A friendly, boisterous man named Lazerus warns them that Birch doesn’t respond to anyone and is best left alone.

The train sets off across a hellish, red-tinged landscape. As it enters a tunnel, magical darkness envelops the car—deeper than any natural or darkvision-enabled sight can pierce. From the blackness come slow, thudding footsteps, a woman's scream, and the sound of bodies hitting the ground.

When light returns, three passengers—Nadia, Carl Robertson, and Lazerus—are dead. Birch is soaked in their blood, still emotionless, holding the gore-stained canister. Enraged, Namby the Tireless attacks Birch, but the blows do nothing. He grows tired—ironically—and is soon killed as well.

But then, impossibly, Lazerus stands back up—cracking jokes about his ruined wardrobe—only to be killed again. He doesn't stay dead long.

Terrified, the party retreats into the train’s engine room, a nightmare fusion of gears, tendons, and dripping fluids. [[Francis]] establishes a psychic connection with the train and uncovers infernal operating instructions. The train should be controlled by arcane programming—but it has long since overridden its design. [[Francis]] discovers that electric shocks to its brain lobes could manipulate it—but access to the brain is only possible via the roof, and the only safe path there lies at the rear of the train.

A large artery runs along the roof, carrying nutrients and hydraulics. It’s passable—barely—for a strong swimmer. Its valves can be opened temporarily by altering the pH. Fearing another deadly tunnel, Conrad volunteers to swim through the artery to the back of the train.

While Conrad traverses the artery, the train enters another tunnel. More strange noises are heard, including what sounds like Birch leaving the passenger car. Reentering the previous car, the party finds Lazerus is once again seated, unbothered. The party pushes onward, moving through the bizarre train cars, including:
- A dining car staffed by flesh golems serving grotesque food.
- An observation car showing panoramic views of the infernal landscape.
- A living quarters car with several disturbing rooms.

Meanwhile, Conrad emerges in a cargo car full of chained-down crates and barrels, eventually reaching the final rear car. There he meets Ramon, an elderly, deranged chain devil who appears to be the source of all the train’s chains. He’s distracted, rambling about someone named “Raymond,” and not overtly hostile.

Back in the living quarters, the party explores several unsettling rooms:
- Birch’s bedroom, decorated with cat portraits, an easel, and deli meats stacked high. In the sink are bloodied skin fragments. A voice endlessly drones from a speaker: “The birch canoe slid along the smooth planks.” They also find a dead cat in a locker and take it.
- A room labeled “Asmodeus’s Asshole”, with a blood-stained sphincter-door. Wisely, they don’t investigate.
- A room housing only a coffin with someone named Mash inside. They steal glowing prayer beads from it.
- A final room that’s empty except for an eye-shaped monitor, showing the view from the front of the train. They hide here when they hear Birch approaching.

After Birch passes—presumably returning to the front—the party exits and continues their grim journey, hoping to find a way to control or survive the nightmare ride.
